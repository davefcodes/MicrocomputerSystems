# MicrocomputerSystems 

This class is about microcomputer architecture and the basic concepts used in the
Personal Computer (PC). Key features of the PC are explored by writing programs in a
high-level language (such as C) to access them. Assembly language programs are utilized to
gain insight into machine-level operations. Laboratory exercises support the lecture and are
carried out in the context of currently available operating systems.
